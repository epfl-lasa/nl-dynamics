I would like to thank particularly Felix Duvallet and Klas Kronander who both have been very available, present and motivative to help and support my work throughout the semester; all this work would not have been possible without them. I would like also to thanks Professor Aude Billard for the chance to do this project in the Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory. Finally I would like to thank all the member of the LASA Laboratory and others who took time to do some of my experiments.
