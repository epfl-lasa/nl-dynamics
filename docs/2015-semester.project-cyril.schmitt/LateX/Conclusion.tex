To conclude this project we can say that the program is working and usable by a majority of people after a small formation on the robot. All the specifications has been completed but there is still place for improvement as we have just seen above. We can finally confirm that creating a dialogue using a state machine is an adaptable, robust and easy way to interact with robots.
