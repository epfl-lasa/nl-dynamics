\subsection{Future work}

Learn corrections using \emph{features} of the state space: this would further enable generalization to novel scenarios.
For example, the command ``keep the tool upright'' or ``stay above the table'' are respectively defined over features of the robot and world states.

Impedance control: change the stiffness of the robot during the task execution.


Handling delays introduced by the speech recognition engine.
