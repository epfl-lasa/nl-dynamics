\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

Our approach performs online modifications of a Dynamical System (DS) trajectory generator, applied to a robot manipulator performing a reaching task (bringing the end effector to a particular goal location).
In many tasks the original dynamics are not enough to successfully complete the task, for example if the user wants the robot to take a specific path.
We leverage the fact that the user can show a demonstration of the desired behavior along with a natural language description of this correction.
We train a model to generalize from the demonstrations to other scenarios, such that the user can simply ``tell'' the robot how to change their behavior in novel domains without the need for any kinesthetic corrections.

We will now describe our trajectory generator formulation as a Modified Dynamical System, how the user provides demonstrations of the desired (correct) behavior along with a natural language description, and how to infer a new controller solely from natural language instructions given during execution.

\subsection{Modified Dynamical System}

We model the desired motion of the robot with a first order autonomous DS:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:DS_general}
  \dot x = f(x)
\end{equation}
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the position of the end-effector of the robot with respect to an external coordinate frame. We will exclusively consider DS models that are stable at a single attractor point. Specifically, we use Locally Modulated Dynamical Systems (LMDS), which uses a basic DS model with known stability properties $\dot x = f^o(x)$ and achieves flexibility by reshaping this model locally:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:DS_reshaped}
  \dot x = f(x) = M(x)f^o(x)
\end{equation}
where $M(x)$ is a matrix valued function that rotates and scales the original dynamics in a continuous manner across the workspace. An example is given in Fig. \ref{figProblemSetup}, which plots the integral curves of a DS over 2d space. In this case, the original dynamics is a linear system and the DS is locally rotated in the right part of workspace. The procedure of reshaping the DS such that it locally aligns with incrementally-arriving training data is described in detail in \todo{add reference to klas's RAS paper}.


\subsection{Demonstrations}

During training, the user can provide.



\subsection{Inferring Controllers from Language}

We begin with a Dynamical System (DS) that encodes the robot goal using an attractor point.
The attractor is simply the state the robot is attempting to reach, and the DS specifies the control input for any robot state.

While this DS could successfully complete the task if there were not obstacles in the environment,


for many tasks: reach the goal

reaching task


this could be insufficient if the user wants to take a specific path


as an example, consider a robot performing a reaching task into a bucket.
If the robot is unable to detect the bucket




Once the user specifies a natural language command, we infer a Modified Dynamical System (MDS) using the learned corrections described previously.
