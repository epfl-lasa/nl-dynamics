\subsection{Dynamical System}
\todo[inline]{Klas fill this in.}

Talk about DS here. Make sure to define DS = Dynamical System.

Note; I think we should introduce the MDS in the last section

\subsection{Demonstrations}

\subsection{Inferring Controllers from Language}

We begin with a Dynamical System (DS) that encodes the robot goal using an attractor point.
The attractor is simply the state the robot is attempting to reach, and the DS dynamics specify how the

Once the user specifies a natural language command, we infer a Modified Dynamical System (MDS) using the learned corrections described previously.
